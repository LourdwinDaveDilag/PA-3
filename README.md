# PA-3 Python Data Analysis
To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library

To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a
Pandas library

# Description
PROBLEM 1

  - Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
  
  - Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars
  

PROBLEM 2

  - Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.
  
  - Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.
  
  - How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?
  
  - Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4
  Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have.

  # Getting Started

  Necessary requirements

  - Jupyter Notebook

  - Anaconda Navigator

  - Coding device (laptops, pc, etc.)

  - Downloaded .csv file

  # Execution of the program

  - On the  very first cell, it is crucial to input "import pandas as pd" in order for the program to run.
